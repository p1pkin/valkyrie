TODO
====

There are loads of TODO/XXX items in the source, grep them!


GENERAL
-------

Add support for "required" field in the JSON file.

For later, write an event-driven scheduler.

I'm seriously thinking about slowling "porting" valkyrie to C++... Mmm.


HIKARU
------

Move the slave GPU access to hikaru-gpu.c. Proper support may require the
introduction of a new vk_device_accessors_t class.

Proper MIE emulation (wrap a Z80 emulator in a vk_cpu_t sub-class and tape
it to the code.)

Proper AICA emulation (especially the RTC and IRQs.)

Implement the three EEPROMs (MAINBD, ROMBD, MIE.)


SH-4
----

Import the LLVM jit core into valkyrie. Still a bit rough on the edges, but
already faster than the interpreter.

Fix the TMU frequency, may help with flashing graphics in PHARRIER.


GPU / RENDERING
---------------

The projection clipping planes are probably scaled by some value, because
using the ones provided by the games as they are leads to a far too close
far clipping plane. Use 'p' to toggle a standard 90 degree FOV projection and
see things (affects all games).

Implement viewports, urgently.

Implement swizzled textures at TEXRAM-write time (BRAVEFF).

Fix instanced rendering; there is no linking system, just odd matrices.

Implement proper light attenuation, requires GLSL.

Figure out where the spotlight angles are (194 is the best candidate).

Implement framebuffer blending (instructions 781, 181; PHARRIER).

Implement mipmap transfers in IDMA (using the L-layout seen in BRAVEFF).

Figure out the effect of mesh LOD on texturing (SGNASCAR).

Implement fogging (see instruction 691).

Implement alpha testing (used in BRAVEFF, instruction 154).

Implement proper model caching using VBOs.


AIRTRIX
-------

Attract mode works.

Emulation wise, the biggest issue is with the player character: it is not
animated. Talking with the Demul guys, we figured out the following: the game
uploads matrix data to CMDRAM  48100000-48100E2x, along with commands, but we
don't know what device that data is for. It is written by the master SH-4 but
never reads them back, and there is strong evidence that the slave SH-4 does
not touch them ever. The matrices come along with a pointer to a GPU routine in
CMDRAM (in master-SH-4-address-space-format), which, guess what?, draws the
player character. I *think* they specify additional transformations to be
applied to the skater body parts, but I don't know yet how.


BRAVEFF
-------

Attract mode works.

Cyber Troops Virtual On 4
-------------------------

Not dumped yet.


PHARRIER
--------

Attract mode works.

3D hiccups, don't know yet why (strategy: monitor writes to CMDRAM, TMU, IRQs,
and reads from GPU ports -- the reason lies there).

The 2D is in ABGR8888 format, but it doesn't always work.

PODRACE
-------

Missing MASKROMS. Won't work.


SGNASCAR
--------

Attract mode works.

The BOOTROM (all version) reads from invalid memory regions when loading the
game data from ROM to RAM; that is likely a game bug.
